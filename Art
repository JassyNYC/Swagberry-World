  <h1>Arrival - Day One</h1>
    <p>Carrying the most heaviest gigantic suitcase and a smaller version but just as heavy was Torture! Dragging it from the 
       airport to the bus station where I stayed for EIGHT hours till my bus arrived.
       Since I landed in Keyflavik Airport in middle of a rainy cold night. Linda from Old School, suggested I stay the night at a
       hostel called Backpackers since I would've missed the last ferry to Hrisey.  
       After getting on the wrong bus with a very irrate Icelandic bus driver who barely understood English, 
       and yelled at me to sit down when I tried to approach him,
       and driving me a half hour out of the way and deliriously sleepy and hungry. I wanted to commit Slap Him across
       his mean head and yell.."STOP THE GOD DAMN BUS, ASSHOLE !!"
       Once off at another bus station in Reykavik, I found a very nice driver who pointed me the bus to Akureyri. 
       Relief!! 
       Feeling a sense of relief, I flung myself on to the bus seat. As I was gazing out the window as the bus drove away, 
       I had only one thought in my head.  To finally reach the island, dump my luggages in the room!</p>
